# `gpmplayer` - Google Play Music Player

A simple curses client for Google Play Music.

I started this project because [thunner][thunner] didn't support Two-Factor
Authentication... or at least I couldn't figure it out. Anyways, writing your
own tool is half the fun, right?

## Dependencies

`gpmplayer` depends on the wonderful [gmusicapi][gmusicapi]. It also uses
appdirs for figuring out where to put its files.

```bash
sudo pip2 install gmusicapi appdirs
```
